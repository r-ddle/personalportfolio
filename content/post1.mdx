summary: "I recently began using Prisma, and it is the best database toolkit I could ever ask for."

At first, I knew nothing about Prisma. I was just struggling to set up MongoDB for my Next.js project. Then, a friend of mine told me about Prisma. That was when I started to appreciate how much effort developers put into creating such incredible libraries, frameworks, and extensions.

Imagine how hard it would've been to create a full-fledged SaaS app back in the day. No AI, no frameworks, or anything like that—just pure JavaScript or maybe PHP.

The `prisma.schema` file is amazing. It looks really clean, and it also generates TypeScript types for you! A good example is:

```tsx
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
const posts = await prisma.posts.findMany();
```

It's so simple to use Prisma to work with multiple databases. If I tried to do this without Prisma using MongoDB, it would've been a lot more complicated.
