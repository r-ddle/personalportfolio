I've been watching a YouTuber called Wesley, aka ByteGrad, for a while now, and the way he teaches things feels exactly like what I needed to learn. I'm not sure how to explain it; it's just the way he simplifies concepts and makes them easy to understand.

He always posts content about how to use Next.js and best practices, and I absolutely love watching his videos. They've helped me become a better developer and learn Next.js more effectively.

So, I went ahead and bought three of his courses: CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js/React.
Right now, I'm working through the JavaScript course.

Update 1: I'm 10% through the JavaScript course, and it's amazing! He teaches everything from the basics, so even a novice can understand what's going on.
